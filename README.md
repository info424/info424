# Hi there, I'm Info/ David!

I'm a passionate developer with experience in web development and Artificial Intelligence. My passion started from 2019, in the Quarantine episode. Back then I was bored, couldn't find something productive to...and then I found about programming. My friend taught me the basics of C++, lend me some tutorials but they seemed very hard.. Then I have switched to an QA role in the Game industry where I have seen plenty of behind-the-scenes , production wise, about games. After that I have started to strengthen my basic fundations on a full-stack course which i have gladly finished in August 2024 Q4. While I was learining the basics of programming, I have found one of my passions which was related towards AI & Automation. That's when I have found about UiPath and have made my day-to-day work automatic. Up next, will be my college project which will be done in Python!
